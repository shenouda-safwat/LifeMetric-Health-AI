> **Decoding the algorithm of a healthy life using synthetic data.**

## 📌 Overview
**LifeMetric** is an End-to-End Machine Learning project designed to evaluate individuals' overall well-being based on physical and lifestyle factors. The project covers the entire pipeline from data acquisition and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to model building and deploying an interactive dashboard.

The goal is to predict an **Overall Health Score (0–100)** based on inputs like sleep, nutrition, physical activity, and stress levels.

## 📂 Dataset
The project uses the **Holistic Health and Lifestyle Score Dataset** sourced from Kaggle.
* **Source:** [Kaggle - Holistic Health and Lifestyle Score Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/miadul/holistic-health-and-lifestyle-score-dataset)
* **Description:** Synthetic data representing real-world health patterns.
* **Features:** `Physical_Activity`, `Nutrition_Score`, `Sleep_Hours`, `Stress_Level`, `BMI`, etc.

## 🛠️ Features
* **📊 Comprehensive EDA:** Correlation matrices, distribution plots, and feature importance analysis.
* **🤖 Machine Learning Models:**
    * **Linear Regression:** Baseline model ($R^2 \approx 0.92$).
    * **Random Forest Regressor:** Advanced model handling non-linearities ($R^2 \approx 0.93$).
* **📱 Interactive Dashboard:** A user-friendly Streamlit app for real-time health score prediction.
